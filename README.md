<i>Experiments in AI-generated Neo4j Cypher queries</i>


---

## About
We investigate the effectiveness of using large language models to generate accurate Cypher queries from natural language queries. We use the HuggingFace [Text2Cypher][1] dataset which contains natural language and Cypher query pairs along with the schemas for 17 public Neo4j databases.
